    <p class="homepage-blog-date-1">April 23, 2021</p>
    <p class="homepage-blog-main-1">Who is actually a web developer? When interpreting the term literally in relation to IT, we could conclude it’s a programmer for websites. It is definitely an IT specialist, which means a programmer, but there is no way to define it precisely, it’s a very general term, and it can only be given a detailed meaning when we specify the scope of tasks or technologies. They are responsible for web applications — mainly for creating them.<br>A web developer has plenty of career paths, sets of skills and possibilities. In most cases, it’s a front-end type programmer who is responsible for the website visible to the end user, its mechanics, the web app. But there are also IT specialists working at the so-called back-end as well as DevOps that are referred to as web developers. Unlike a web architect, a web developer doesn’t specialize in graphics or aesthetics of WWW on the designing side. Neither is its content itself within the scope of tasks of a front-end developer, the content is taken care of by the client, a copywriter or the person in charge of SEO.</p>

    <h5 class="homepage-blog-head-2">Website design-How to start?</h5>
    <p class="homepage-blog-date-2">March 21, 2021</p>
    <p class="homepage-blog-main-2">Designing a website starts with defining the role the website is meant to serve, or its purpose.You’re guessing right – there are different types of websites that are used for different purposes. The three most popular ones are: landing pages, one-pages and classic websites. Obviously, there are also large sites (portals and the like), but that’s a completely different topic.The simplest types of websites are landing page and one-page.<br>Although they are usually small in size (they only have a single page), they have quite a lot of content on them. However, they differ in their purpose.What is a landing page? In simple words, it’s a destination page that is usually intended for collecting leads or gathering traffic related to a certain action. Landing pages usually don’t have much content, but the page’s purpose is clearly visible. In most cases, landing pages don’t have a menu.<br>One-pages are kind of like “stretched” versions of regular websites.
